    <h1>Cirriculum viate</h1>
    <p>As a 1st year student I’m a very resourceful individual with excellent analytical, communication and interpersonal skills. I have experience of working with a wide range of people from different backgrounds including school mates at both my level and senior colleagues, during summer holidays I worked in a family friend restaurant and my duties included serving customers and taking their meal order. I also did stock taking and making sure that the environment was clean and safe. Furthermore I have experience in working face to face with members of the public, I’m a team player as I can approach under pressure and I can use my own initiative when I need to. Moreover, I’m a quick learner and always keen to learn new things. I’m a great decision maker and I thrive to perform at the best of my ability. I am very good at saving money underpinned by a business streak with parental guidance. Also, I have experience with working as I contributed in work experience which was run by my school. </p>
